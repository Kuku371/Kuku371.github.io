<h1>Who is Keshav?</h1>

My name is Keshav Karumbunathan, and I am a sophomore at Jesuit High School in Portland, Oregon. I am a student who is passionate about mathematics, computer science, quantum computing, and swimming.

My journey in mathematics is a combination of college-level coursework, math competitions & camps, and independent research. I am familiar with subjects including multivariable calculus, group theory, advanced probability theory, analytical number theory, and linear algebra. Through organizations like AoPS, Euler Circle, and MIT OpenCourseWare, I have been able to study a variety of math concepts and pursue pure mathematics research. I have qualified for the Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program through strong showings on the USA Mathematics Olympiad and similar contests. I am a leader of the Oregon Math Circle that annually competes in out-of-state competitions, and I am a role model for younger students wishing to pursue math in their future careers. I compete in the USA Coding Olympiad silver division with advanced knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and coding languages including C++, Python, and Java. I have recently started research in quantum computing ranging form quantum states to algorithms. To balance out my educational work, I swim daily as a member of the Dolphins swim team. Feel free to visit different sections of my website to see my personal experiences, groups, and research.

<h1>What are Keshav's hobbies?</h1>

My biggest hobby is playing and watching basketball. I've been a Portland Trailblazers fanatic for most of my life, going to watch several of their games in-person every year and seeing the rest on my TV. I enjoy solving Rubik's cubes, jogging, camping, and gaming with my friends.

<h1>What can me/my child do to advance mathematically?</h1>

This is a great question that I've heard a lot! If you're a high school or middle schooler from Oregon and have a decent background in competition math, I would highly recommend joining the <a href="https://www.oregonmathcircle.org" target="_blank">Oregon Math Circle</a> for more advice and practice with other students. My starting point was the <a href="https://www.aops.com" target="_blank">Art of Problem Solving</a> classes and books. Most of these are especially useful for competition mathematics that aren't taught in the normal school curriculum, and the rest(like Calculus, Group Theory, etc.) can help you prepare for college-level classes. I am also in the process of writing my own [book](/_pages/books.md) which is targeted for middle schoolers at the MathCounts chapter/mid-AMC 8 level.

If you wish to enrich yourself with college-level material, I would recommend self-studying them from lecture videos or college websites online or joining the [Euler Circle](https://eulercircle.com/). If you are at the AIME level and want to try to advance to the USA(J)MO I would recommend joining [OTIS](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html), which is regarded as the best resource for advanced competition techniques.
