<h2>What can me/my child do to advance mathematically?</h2>

This is a great question that I've heard a lot! If you're a high school or middle schooler from Oregon and have a decent background in competition math, I would highly recommend joining the <a href="https://www.oregonmathcircle.org" target="_blank">Oregon Math Circle</a> for more advice and practice with other students. My starting point was the <a href="https://www.aops.com" target="_blank">Art of Problem Solving</a> classes and books. Most of these are especially useful for competition mathematics that aren't taught in the normal school curriculum, and the rest(like Calculus, Group Theory, etc.) can help you prepare for college-level classes. AoPS also offers a huge problem bank of all past AMC problems for free practice. I am also in the process of writing my own [book](/_pages/books.md) which is targeted for middle schoolers at the MathCounts chapter/mid-AMC 8 level.

If you wish to enrich yourself with college-level material, I would recommend self-studying them from lecture videos or college websites online or joining the [Euler Circle](https://eulercircle.com/). If you are at the AIME level and want to try to advance to the USA(J)MO I would recommend joining [OTIS](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html), which is regarded as the best resource for advanced competition techniques.

<h2>How much of a time commitment is necessary to reach different stages of math competitions?</h2>

This answer varies a lot between different people. What matters more than the amount of time you put in is the quality of the work. It's important to annually track your goals and create a lists of tasks you can do to achieve them. You shouldn't blindy try to start competing by attempting to complete every single online course there is- you should have a general sense of the direction you are heading in. For me, I only spend around 10-15 hours every week preparing for math competitions, but that is largely due to the fact I started at a young age and have paced myself since then. You should make sure your life isn't solely based around competition math, because then you're probably 1) going to burn out and 2) be lost once you enter college. Again, I can't stress enough that commitment varies by person, and it's important to have a parent/coach who can help you plan out your vision.

<h2>What do you do when you get stuck on a hard problem?</h2>

Believe it or not, this happens to everyone no matter their level. For me, I only decide I'm fully stuck if after certain intervals of time I've made relatively no progress on the problem at hand. For me, for short-answer contest problems this is around 1 hour, for olympiad problems it's 3 hours, for advanced coursework it's around 1 day, and for research problems it's around 1 week. It's important to make sure you've given the problem your best attempt before deciding you probably won't get it in the future. This shouldn't be the case for over 38% of your problems, otherwise the level you're aiming at is too high.

If the problem has a solution online, when I officially decide I'm done the first thing I do is read the first few lines of the solution and see if it rings any bells from where I can finish the problem. If it doesn't, I just continue and finish reading the full solution. The most important part of this process is then revisiting the same problem 2 weeks later and seeing if you are now able to solve and write up a neat solution without any help. I keep on repeating this process until I get the problem/contest fully correct. If the problem you are solving does not have a public solution avaiable, the best advice I have is to share it with any friends or teachers who would be interested in solving the problem. Sharing ideas is typically the most effective way to combine skillsets allowing you to attempt the problem from a new angle. Assuming the problem isn't part of a class, I would also recommend in the worst-case scenario posting it on an online forum(AoPS forums, Stack Exchange) where people actively provide assistance.

<h2>Do you have any advice for how to handle yourself before, during, and after a competition?</h2>

Prior to the competition, it's important to have a personalized routine to calm youself down and 'lock in'. For inspiration, mine is taking a walk outside while listening to a music playlist right before going into the competition room. Inside there, I focus on my breathing to slow down my heartrate. It's important that this routine doesn't involve practing math formulas because that can stress you out even more. During the competition, there's not much advice I can provide other than to give it everything you've got. If you feel stuck on a problem, skip it and come back to it later rather than wasting your time.

After the contest ends and you get your results back, it's important to note that **your contest results do not define you** as a person. There are no good days unless there is something known as a bad day, and vice versa, so just go with the flow no matter what happens. Stay humble in victory and gracious in defeat. That being said, underperforming is likely due to not having good quality practice and coming in unprepared. Don't simply ignore the fact that you do badly, but use it to fuel a better performance next time by tweaking your practice habits.
