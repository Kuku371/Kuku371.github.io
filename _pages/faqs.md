<h1>What can me/my child do to advance mathematically?</h1>

This is a great question that I've heard a lot! If you're a high school or middle schooler from Oregon and have a decent background in competition math, I would highly recommend joining the <a href="https://www.oregonmathcircle.org" target="_blank">Oregon Math Circle</a> for more advice and practice with other students. My starting point was the <a href="https://www.aops.com" target="_blank">Art of Problem Solving</a> classes and books. Most of these are especially useful for competition mathematics that aren't taught in the normal school curriculum, and the rest(like Calculus, Group Theory, etc.) can help you prepare for college-level classes. I am also in the process of writing my own [book](/_pages/books.md) which is targeted for middle schoolers at the MathCounts chapter/mid-AMC 8 level.

If you wish to enrich yourself with college-level material, I would recommend self-studying them from lecture videos or college websites online or joining the [Euler Circle](https://eulercircle.com/). If you are at the AIME level and want to try to advance to the USA(J)MO I would recommend joining [OTIS](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html), which is regarded as the best resource for advanced competition techniques.
