<h2>What can me/my child do to advance mathematically?</h2>

This is a great question that I've heard a lot! If you're a high school or middle schooler from Oregon and have a decent background in competition math, I would highly recommend joining the <a href="https://www.oregonmathcircle.org" target="_blank">Oregon Math Circle</a> for more advice and practice with other students. My starting point was the <a href="https://www.aops.com" target="_blank">Art of Problem Solving</a> classes and books. Most of these are especially useful for competition mathematics that aren't taught in the normal school curriculum, and the rest(like Calculus, Group Theory, etc.) can help you prepare for college-level classes. AoPS also offers a huge problem bank of all past AMC problems for free practice. I am also in the process of writing my own [book](/_pages/books.md) which is targeted for middle schoolers at the MathCounts chapter/mid-AMC 8 level.

If you wish to enrich yourself with college-level material, I would recommend self-studying them from lecture videos or college websites online or joining the [Euler Circle](https://eulercircle.com/). If you are at the AIME level and want to try to advance to the USA(J)MO I would recommend joining [OTIS](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html), which is regarded as the best resource for advanced competition techniques.

<h2>How much of a time commitment is necessary to reach different stages of math competitions?</h2>

This answer varies a lot between different people. What matters more than the amount of time you put in is the quality of the work. It's important to annually track your goals and create a lists of tasks you can do to achieve them. You shouldn't blindy try to start competing by attempting to complete every single online course there is- you should have a general sense of the direction you are heading in. For me, I only spend around 10-15 hours every week preparing for math competitions, but that is largely due to the fact I started at a young age and have paced myself since then. You should make sure your life isn't solely based around competition math, because then you're probably 1) going to burn out and 2) be lost once you enter college. Again, I can't stress enough that commitment varies by person, and it's important to have a parent/coach who can help you plan out your vision.
