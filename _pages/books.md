[This](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nzn7_1a_NAUkzgnqBcDpuJzIRZizFmKq/view?usp=sharing) is a link to my Quantum Connect 4 game I created invididually(it runs as an executable through Google Drive). The program is written in Python with over 700 lines and incorporates the random, math, time, tkinter, and turtle libraries. The game takes a spin on the usual connect 4 game with 3 levels that incorporate coins which are a superposition of red & yellow that collapse under measurement and can possibly be entangled, as well as columns that act as specific quantum gates. I am in the process of creating a smart robot which allows a one-player mode by using several complex algorithms. Please email me if you find any bugs in the latest update of the game.


I am currently in the process of creating a math competition book for middle schoolers. This book aims to teach students entering MathCounts and the AMC competition series different strategies, techniques, and information about the contests themselves. The book will feature mock tests as well as a very large problem bank containing hints and solutions to every problem.
