    <div class="org-description" id="desc-1">
      <p>We are an Oregon-wide math circle for high school students interested in math. We host weekly meetings, problem-of-the-days (computational and proof), annual contests, and also have an active and engaging Discord server. While our primary focus is on competition math, we also have a strong emphasis on non-competition topics and encourage students to explore all areas of mathematics. We are a student-run organization, and our leaders are dedicated to providing a fun and engaging environment for all students. Each year, we attend in-person competitions including the American Regional Mathematics League(ARML), the Harvard-MIT Math Tournament(HMMT), and the Stanford Math Tournanment(SMT). For more information about our math circle, you can go to <a href="https://www.oregonmathcircle.org" target="_blank">this link</a>. </p>
      <p>I have been a member of the math circle since 2022, and a leader of the math circle since 2024. I am involved in running meetings, sending out club information emails, and planning our trips. I also have been writing Problem of the Days for our club, which are free-access problems posted daily on our Discord server that model competition problems.</p>

    <p>The Dolphins Portland Swimming (TDPS) is a coach-owned club sanctioned by USA Swimming. The USA Swimming and Oregon Swimming, Inc. (OSI) organizations govern our club.

    <p>I have been a member of the Dolphins swim team since 2015. I started swimming competitively in 2017, and since then, I have qualified for every OSI state short-course championship in multiple events. My latest accomplishment was getting a 10th place overall finish in the 100 yard backstroke finals at the state meet this March. I have been part of the Green Squad, the Dolphins highest level swimming group, since 2023.</p>

    <div class="org-description" id="desc-6">
    <p>Beaverton City Library's Teen Library Council (TLC) offers teens the opportunity to make a positive difference in the community and have input in the way the library serves teens. Members plan, promote, and help out with teen & children's library programs, help judge writing & art contests, give back by helping with community outreach projects, and work as a team gaining leadership experience. For more information, visit <a href="https://www.beavertonlibrary.org/232/Teen-Library-Council" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>
    <p>I was a former member of the Beaverton TLC during two terms between 2023-2025. I helped record podcasts which are posted on the library website, and I ran events like Oregon Battle of the Books(OBOB) mock competitions. I volunteered for over 25 hours in various events from art contests to free comic books days. </p>

    <div class="org-description" id="desc-2">
    <p> Math Wizards is the ultimate springboard to your success. Over the courses coming out, students will learn the tools they need to achieve their goals and thrive in today’s competitive world. This course will help them with many middle school-level competitions, such as the AMC8. It can also help them excel in their school math. For more information, visit <a href="https://keshavkarumbu0.wixsite.com/" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>
    <p>I created the startup of the MathWizards in 2024, and succesfully taught a class of 20 students how to prepare for the AMC8. All money received was donated to charity, and students felt an enormous leap in their math skills. Though the program hasn't been unbanded, I've listed this as a previous group due to the low chance we will end up running more sessions.</p>
