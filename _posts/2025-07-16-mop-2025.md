**Note:** I have limited this post to a brief outline my personal experiences at MOP, so it won't cover any complaints about particular policies, staff, or unfortunate incidents that occured during camp.

Yay this is my first blog post! MOP was an incredible experience, and I enjoyed making new friends, learning new techniques and math brainrot. MOP 2025 was held at the Illinois Math and Science Academy in Aurora.

Upon arrival, I got to pick up an MAA nametag and a pickleball set provided by $2\sigma$. My roommate was Cezar, an international student from Romania who had arrived a few days prior for pre-MOP. I ended up needing to use the upper bunk for this reason, which was unfortunate because I would typically sleep much later than Cezar and ended up waking him up because of how creaky the stairs were. The upper bunk was also super cramped without a railing either and I ended up hitting my head on the ceiling a few times. Eventually I got more used to it and it became pretty cozy.
