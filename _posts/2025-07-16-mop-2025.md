**Note:** I have limited this post to a brief outline my personal experiences at MOP, so it won't cover any complaints about particular policies, staff, or unfortunate incidents that occured during camp.

Yay this is my first blog post! MOP was an incredible experience, and I enjoyed making new friends, learning new techniques and math brainrot. MOP 2025 was held at the Illinois Math and Science Academy in Aurora. For those who don't know, MOP is a free, 3-week camp used to start the next year's IMO and RMM team selection process, that students qualify for by scoring a high enough score on the USA(J)MO.

Upon arrival, I got to pick up an MAA nametag and a pickleball set provided by $2\sigma$. My roommate was Cezar, an international student from Romania who had arrived a few days prior for pre-MOP(he also designed the MOP t-shirts). I ended up needing to use the upper bunk, which was unfortunate because I would typically sleep much later than Cezar and ended up waking him up because of how creaky the stairs were. The upper bunk was also super cramped without a railing either and I ended up hitting my head on the ceiling a few times. Eventually I got more used to it and it became pretty cozy.

During weekdays we alternated between test and non-test days. On test days we'd have 2 morning classes, a test from 12:30-5:00, and then test review as our main activities. On non-test days we'd instead have an extra evening class and more free time throughout the day. 

The classes were very exciting, and most of the instructors were decorated IMO medalists at some point in their career. Suprisingly, almost all of them now work at quant companies. Speaking of which, we had visits from $2\sigma$, Citadel Securities, and Jane Street who each hosted unique events like estimathons and gave our lots of free merch. Most classes were a small lecture followed by over an hour of solving targeted problem sets consisting of various olympiad problems. I was placed in the Green group at MOP, and some of our more exciting classes were:

* Determinants(used in path counting)
* Complex Bash
* Quadratic Inequalities
* Subset Family
* Field Extensions
* Spiral Similarity

Shoutout to Leo, Evan, and Daniel who were all in my table group and groupsolved problems with me during the classes. I'll also mention Connor, who wasn't part of our actual table group but joined us for a lot of problem discussion.

Even though we had a lot of classes, most of my day was full of free time. I was part of the MOPdash food delivery system which acted as a cheaper version of DoorDash to our customers. We'd run and pick up food from restraunts in groups and then come back and deliver them. Aside from that, I played some basketball, video games with others, and especially a lot of brawl stars.

We had a total of 8 tests throughout camp. The last three were all TSTST(Team Selection Team Selection Test) which are used to decide the TST(Team Selection Test) group for 2025-26. The ~30 students in that group then take more tests to decide the next year's IMO and RMM teams. Three of the tests were MOP tests distributed by color group that contain some selection of the 2024 IMO Shortlist problems which were just released yesterday. The final two tests were part of the ELMO, a team contest for first-timers(though the team aspect is just a combination of individual scores). I was drafted into Ohio Rizz(ORZ) even though the team was supposed to be compromised of people who live relatively close to Ohio. We also technically had two more unofficial team contests for students in red and green group, and my team placed first in the latter one.

Ironically, my 3 best days were the first day of the TSTST, Green Group tests, and ELMO. I ended up getting a Silver medal individually with a $10$th place finish on the ELMO with a score of 771 070. The green group tests went alright, but I didn't think much of them since they were just for practice. I unfortunetly didn't end up making the TST group, largely due to the fact I didn't get a single 5+ on day 2, which was the easiest over all 3 days. I blame this on the fact the only vegetarian option prior to the test was salad, so a stomach ache bothered me in the second half of the test. Hopefully next year I can make it back and not screw up so I have a potential shot at RMM.

I also proposed [problem 5 of the Revenge ELMO](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6t1667680f6h3602278_continuous_fe), which is written by first-time MOPpers for returners. There were also lots of other activities ran at MOP by staff. One of these was Blotto, which was a head-to-head strategy game where individuals would submit numbers that would be scored against other submissions using certain formulas. There were a total of 5 rounds, and I was one of the top 3 who qualified for the final round live during the talent show. I ended up winning and I got an icosahedron as my prize!

Arguably the most exciting part of the trip was the Chicago trip in the last weekend. My group went to the art museum, but a small group including me wandered off together to a boba shop and millenium park, which had the infamous Chicago Bean. I think we spent more time in tranportation along busses and trains than we actually did in Chicago, but it was also fun because we were able to play One-Night Ultimate Werewolf and buy hot chocolate(from vending machines!?).

It definetely took a toll on me when I had the moment of realization I would never be able to return back at the end of camp. I made some awesome memories and would especially like to thank all the MOP coordinators, instructors, and graders who made it such a great experience. I would also like to thank IMSA despite some controversy for letting us use their campus and facilities. That's all!
